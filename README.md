# CaseBot
We will be creating a twitter bot that will accept subscribers and publish live case reports daily via direct message. In order to do this, our twitter bot will pull data from a covid19 api to notify people of cases in the location specified in a userâ€™s bio.


Used tweepy to implement twitter commands.


ANDY: Changed twitter bot from java to python and able to direct message people, respond to dms, and create a dictionary with the subscribed twitter users and their preffered location.

MILES: For next submission I will analyze case data to discover daily new cases and deaths by state.
