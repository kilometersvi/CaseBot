# CaseBot
We will be creating a twitter bot that will accept subscribers and publish live case reports daily via direct message. In order to do this, our twitter bot will pull data from a covid19 api to notify people of cases in the location specified in a userâ€™s bio.


Used a github repository by Ria Galanos found at https://github.com/riagalanos/cs1-twitter 

Able to use twitter4J java docs in order to achieve teh goal.


ANDY: For next submission I will figure out how to DM followers of the twitter account. Start learing how to have re-occuring DM message to update followers.
